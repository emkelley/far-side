        <p class="text-lg">
          In the year 2205, Earth is devastated by a catastrophic event known as
          "The Fall"â€”a relentless meteor shower that lasts for months. Humanity
          is pushed to the brink of extinction, and the survivors are left to
          rebuild society in a world forever changed by the disaster. The
          remnants of humanity now live in small, isolated communities,
          scavenging for resources and trying to adapt to their new
          surroundings.

        <p class="text-lg">
          The Moon, once a symbol of hope, now represents humanity's last chance
          to escape the dying Earth. Rumors spread of an ancient spaceport with
          a rocket ship still intact, buried beneath the ruins of a once-great
          city. The survivors must band together, gather resources, and develop
          their technologies in a race against time to build the necessary
          supplies and finally reach the Moon. Along the way, they face
          hardships, obstacles, and challenges in their quest to save the future
          of the human race.

          The Age of Reconstruction (2215-2230)
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
          As humanity struggles to rebuild, the scattered remnants of
          civilization form alliances and engage in trade to help each other
          survive in the post-apocalyptic world. New settlements, though
          primitive, begin to emerge from the ashes, and people's
          resourcefulness and adaptability become their greatest strengths. In
          the face of adversity, these communities develop ingenious methods to
          harness the limited resources of their environment, devising
          innovative machines and tools to optimize their efforts.

          The Journey to the Stars (2230-2250)
        </h2>
        <p class="text-lg">
          While the majority of humanity focuses on rebuilding Earth, a select
          group of visionaries dares to look beyond the horizon. They recognize
          that Earth's resources are finite, and with the ever-present threat of
          another cataclysm, they realize that the long-term survival of the
          human race depends on establishing a new home beyond our planet. These
          brave individuals embark on a perilous journey to uncover the secrets
          of the ancient spaceport, facing hostile remnants of the old world,
          inhospitable environments, and dangerous creatures that have evolved
          in the wake of The Fall. As they uncover the knowledge and technology
          of the past, they inspire others to join their cause and work together
          to forge a new destiny for humanity among the stars.
