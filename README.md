## Lore

##### The Fall (2205)
In the year 2205, Earth is devastated by a catastrophic event known as "The Fall"â€”a relentless meteor shower that lasts for months. Humanity is pushed to the brink of extinction, and the survivors are left to rebuild society in a world forever changed by the disaster. The remnants of humanity now live in small, isolated communities, scavenging for resources and trying to adapt to their new surroundings.

##### A New Hope: The Moon (2210)
The Moon, once a symbol of hope, now represents humanity's last chance to escape the dying Earth. Rumors spread of an ancient spaceport with a rocket ship still intact, buried beneath the ruins of a once-great city. The survivors must band together, gather resources, and develop their technologies in a race against time to build the necessary supplies and finally reach the Moon. Along the way, they face hardships, obstacles, and challenges in their quest to save the future of the human race.

##### The Age of Reconstruction (2215-2230)
As humanity struggles to rebuild, the scattered remnants of civilization form alliances and engage in trade to help each other survive in the post-apocalyptic world. New settlements, though primitive, begin to emerge from the ashes, and people's resourcefulness and adaptability become their greatest strengths. In the face of adversity, these communities develop ingenious methods to harness the limited resources of their environment, devising innovative machines and tools to optimize their efforts.

##### The Journey to the Stars (2230-2250)
While the majority of humanity focuses on rebuilding Earth, a select group of visionaries dares to look beyond the horizon. They recognize that Earth's resources are finite, and with the ever-present threat of another cataclysm, they realize that the long-term survival of the human race depends on establishing a new home beyond our planet. These brave individuals embark on a perilous journey to uncover the secrets of the ancient spaceport, facing hostile remnants of the old world, inhospitable environments, and dangerous creatures that have evolved in the wake of The Fall. As they uncover the knowledge and technology of the past, they inspire others to join their cause and work together to forge a new destiny for humanity among the stars.
